# Network Traffic Modeling Tool

## Overview
Welcome to the Network Traffic Modeling Tool! In this challenge, I've developed a tool that can analyze a network described in a CSV file, incorporate traffic data, and model the flow of traffic over the network. The primary goal is to determine the utilization of each link within the network, providing valuable insights for network designers.

### Features
Load Network Data: The tool allows you to load network information from a CSV file. The file describes the structure of the network, including nodes, edges, and capacities.

Traffic Modeling: By incorporating traffic data, the tool models the flow of traffic over the network. This modeling enables the assessment of network utilization under normal conditions.

Worst Case Failure Scenario: Additionally, the tool implements the modeling of the worst-case failure scenario. This feature helps network owners understand how their network behaves in the event of a critical failure.

Output Results: The tool provides the option to output the results in CSV format. This output includes crucial information about the utilization of each link, giving network designers insights into the performance of their network.
